===============

This contains opensource to create todo list along with persistence to store them in appjangle cloud.
This jquery plugin helps you to create your todos and do the general operations in a todo list.
Following are the operations possible:
* Add a new todo item
* remove a existing todo item.
* Mark all items as completed  and viceversa.
* Mark a selected item as completed and viceversa.
* Clear all completed todos.

Also, all the todos are saved in a cloud based non-relational database (Appjangle cloud), whose url is shown to user. The cloud based url and a secret (like a password token) is displayed when you start the todo list.

You can also load a already stored todo list from the cloud using the URL and secret.You can also perform all the operations mentioned above with a loaded todo list.

This is compatible with latest versions of FixeFox, Chrome and IE9+ browsers.
